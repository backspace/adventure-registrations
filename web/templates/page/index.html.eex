      <p>You are a member of a secret society with a mission of the utmost importance.</p>
      <p>You will have encounters with other members around the PATH where you will obtain information to get closer to fulfilling your mission.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Clandestine Rendezvous is an adventure taking place in downtown Toronto’s PATH <em>during the day</em> on Friday, February 5, 2016. Participants receive a set of appointment cards that direct them to specific locations at precise times at which they will meet other operatives and exchange information with them. Each rendezvous will provide a clue to solve the case.</p>

    <h4><i class='fa fa-sun-o'></i> During the day?!</h4>
    <p>Yes, the event is taking place during a Friday afternoon to take full advantage of spaces that are only accessible at such times. If you work maybe you can book a day off? Skip school?</p>
    <p>It will start some time in the early afternoon, around 14:00, and last about 2.5 hours.</p>

    <h4><i class='fa fa-user-secret'></i> Who?</h4>
    <p>Anyone is invited to attend. You should have a sense of adventure and stealth and be willing to attempt to pass as a person entitled to visit downtown buildings, lest your mission be compromised. You can go alone or with a partner.</p>

    <h4><i class='fa fa-dollar'></i> Cost</h4>
    <p>A $5 donation is requested to cover printing costs and labour. If that’s too much, any amount (including 0) is welcome.</p>

    <h4><i class='fa fa-universal-access'></i> Accessibility</h4>
    <p>Do you have accessibility needs we should know about? Please tell us <%= link "when you register", to: registration_path(@conn, :new) %> and we will work with you to ensure you can participate.</p>

    <h4><i class='fa fa-pencil'></i> Registration</h4>
    <p>You <em>must</em> <%= link "register", to: registration_path(@conn, :new) %> to attend the event, as scheduling each rendezvous depends on knowing who will attend. If you’re uncertain whether you can make it, register anyway; you can cancel up until XXXX.</p>

    <h4><i class='fa fa-question-circle'></i> Questions</h4>

    <p><strong>This is not the registration form, that’s <%= link "here", to: registration_path(@conn, :new) %>.</strong></p>
